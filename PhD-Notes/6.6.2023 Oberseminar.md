# Investigating the lipid production of *Plasmodium falciparum* using GEMs and FBA
###### by Maxim Karnetzki
-----------------------------------------
What are GEMs

---------------------------------------
What is FBA

------------------------
*P. falciparum* GEMs

| 2010 Explosion | Plata | Forth | Huthmacher |
|---|---|---|---|
|Origin| Yeast model as basis |  Scratch from active genes | Scratch KEGG reactions  |
|Biomass| Modified Yeast biomass  | Metabolomics  |   |
| Aim| | | Investigate gene activity in different life stages of *P.fal*|
| | | | |

-----------------------------------

|2017 Continuation|Carey |Chiappino-Pepe|
|---|---|---|
| Origin | Plata | scratch, genes |
|Biomass|Modified Plata, with data relating to *P.fal*| Forth  |
|Aim|Investigate gene activity of artemisinin resistance|Bigger better model and study thermodynamic constraints|

Conundrum, which model to choose?
1. Compatibility
2. Metabolic reference -> memote.io
3. Biomass 
4. Medium -> notebook compare
5. metabolic tasks -> individual notebook
7. lipid biomass -> individual notebook
8. lipid production -> individual notebook
