- Acyl-CoA mostly referred as compound for activation of FA 
- part of elongation, $\beta$ oxidation / degradation of FAs and DAG production 
Another crucial step in the intraerythrocytic modification of imported host FA may involve acyl-CoA synthetase enzymes, which activate acyl chains for entry into FA synthesis, desaturation, and elongation pathways. Members of this gene family are present in 4–12 copies in _Plasmodium_ species, and biochemical assays have shown 20–fold higher acyl-CoA synthetase activity in infected versus uninfected RBC ([Bethke et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646117/#R3); [Vial and Ancelin, 1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646117/#R38)).
