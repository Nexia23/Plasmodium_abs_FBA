describes the function of PLSCR1 #experiments 
Basic enzyme information:
- Activated by #Ca²⁺
- Suppressed by #Cholesterol

PS exposure is promoted by activation of scramblase activity caused by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. #PS

Scramblase bidirejwodke/corona_model/-/ci/editor?branch_name=master&tab=1ctionally translocates a wide variety of phospholipids in Ca2+-dependent and ATP-independent manners. #scramblase 
## Summary for modelling #asymmetry_model
- PLSCR1 seems to be an important scramblase for the #RBC plasma membrane #PM
- activated by #Ca²⁺
- su### Problems #debate
On going debate about the role of PLSCR1 as scramblase, since in mice RBC PLSCR1 is not expressed, casting doubt about its role as major scramblase, which this group promotes very much. 
They measured the expression levels of PLSCR1 in humans to conclude this: 
>The most plausible conclusion is that PLSCR1 is indeed the scramblase in human erythrocytes whereas PLSCR3 may serve this purpose in the mouse.ppressed by #Cholesterol, even in situations where Ca²⁺ has no influence
- activation and suppression are distinct features

### Methods
Chemicals:
FITC-annexin V, #annexin_V fluorophor binds #PS in outer membrane
methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD, C4555), #cholesterol depletion
N-Ethylmaleimide ( #NEM, 054-02063) inactivates #flippase
NBC-Phospholipid( here PC & PS), phospholipid analogon which's head group is fluorescence #NBC

Using the chemicals mentioned above the #scramblase #PLSCR1 activity was measured under different conditions. 
#NEM is used to block flippase activity by ATP binding inhibition. #MBCD is used to deplete the RBC's PM of cholesterol. With annexin_V as fluorescence reporter, as it binds the PS on the outer membrane, the PLSCR1 scramblase activity was measured, since it moves PS outwards. A second set of experiments uses fluorophor tagged PLs to measure internalization rates under the same conditions.

Different PLSCR1 where used to prove it's function:
- Mutant is MBP-PLSCR1
- human PLSCR1 purified from RBCs
- murine PLSCR1

### Results
Annexin V binding assay showing the difference in PS exposure depending on the treatment of the cells. The cells where put in different Ca²⁺ concentrations as it is a known factor for protein mediated PL transmembrane transfer. Cells are annexin V positive, if PS in outer membrane. 5mM MBCD was used supposed reduction of Cholesterol by ~40%, 0.5mM NEM was used to block flippase activity 2µM of Ionophor A23187 was used to make the membrane permeable for Ca²⁺.

Control line has around 5% annexin V positive cells, treating cells with either the flippase blocker NEM or cholesterol depletion results in higher annexin V positive cells. Depending on the Ca²⁺ concentration the relative amount of annexin V positive cells is different. MBCD treated cells plateau after a relative small amount of Ca²⁺ while the NEM rises ever so slightly, which can be explained with the Ca²⁺ activation of a scramblase. Combination of both treatments is additive and increases PS exposure.

The effect of cholesterol depletion was reversed by addition of cholesterol, which also reduced the annexin V positive cells. Evidence of cholesterol #regulation.

>In contrast, the presence of PLSCR1 fluorescence intensity doubled, indicating that #PLSCR1 accelerated NBD-PC scrambling from the outer to inner leaflet of the liposomes. Strikingly, the presence of cholesterol in the liposomes abolished this PLSCR1-dependent scrambling, whether assayed with NBD-PC or NBD-PS.

>... PLSCR1 and no cholesterol even at #Ca²⁺ concentrations of < 1 µM, equivalent to those in the normal human erythrocyte. We conclude that, while calcium is required for the activity of #PLSCR1, the protein can function at concentrations much lower than those previously reported to be necessary in the absence of cholesterol.

>In this study, we could show that #PLSCR1 formed an oligomer, suggesting that it functions by producing a cluster with an integral hole or channel that allows passage of phospholipid hydrophilic head regions.

PLSCR1 is suggested to be an oligomer (5-8 subunits, possible a tunnel for the polar head-group of the PL) in the PM and cholesterol might hinder this merization.
