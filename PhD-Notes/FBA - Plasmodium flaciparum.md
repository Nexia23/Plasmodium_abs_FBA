### Goals
Use FBA to analyse lipid metabolic development during the asexual stages. Previously published GEM #ipfa or #ipfal21 is used and modified to represent the lipid metabolism adequately. As results resource, energy and carbon fluxes will be calculated so that a computationally reliable estimate on the metabolic burden on the parasite can be predicted. 
- #SLIMEr is implemented to facilitate lipid representation.
- Biomass function rewritten
- run different FBAs
	1. normal FBA for different stages
	2.  pFBA
