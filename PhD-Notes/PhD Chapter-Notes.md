## Data Chapter
#### Part 1 Enzyme kinetic dictionary
- all data available on each enzyme emphasis on missing values
	- show that correlation between mRNA and protein abundance shaky to non existent 
		- hint for post translational regulation or mRNA regulation
------------------------------------------
#### Part 2 Lipodomics meta-analysis 
Alex Maier data-set
- many unsaturated PLs which side chains are not measured as FAs PC 38:7
	- Problem of the data set or inherent because of the PL import
	- Using unsaturation as marker for transport? 
**Questions to answer**:
- what are the differences between absolute and published relative lipodomics data sets
	- is there similar relative distribution
	- difference in inference:
		- PS does not grow in relative data sets(% of total lipid amount) but does in absolute
**Interesting open questions**:
- what is really produced by the parasite and what is imported and used as is
	- could this be inferred from the data and the up-to-date known metabolic capabilities of the parasite during the asexual blood stage
- structural and biophysical membrane property consequences of changing lipid distribution
	- as the lipid distribution changes speculation on the membrane properties

## FBA Chapter

#### Part 1 Intro to the available GEMs
- explanation of educated choice of model for further analysis
#### Part 2 FBA
- SLIMEr calculations
	- stage dependent mass estimation
	- permutation distribution of not measured side chains in PLs (36:0)
- Medium definition
	- constrain influx-fluxes 
		- Tewari et al. used Oleszewski data of measured medium consumption to constrain in-flux values 
			- recalibration needed to suit my models
- flux analysis part
	- are major metabolic shifts observable
	- flux variability
	- minimal medium
	- calculate carbon foot-print and over metabolic requirements(ATP, etc.)
	- estimation of enzymatic capabilities to sustain such a flux
