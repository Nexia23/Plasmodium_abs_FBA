#### Changes from #Frickenhaus #Frickenhaus_1999:
- protein mediated transport :
	- simplification of transport reactions
		- one step like a tunnel
		- two step with protein bound intermediate stage
	- add regulation:
		- K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Cholesterol:
			- Flippase #recherche :
				- Activator: Ca²⁺
				- Activator:  K⁺
				- Non-competitive Inhibition: Cholesterol might influence membrane location of flippase (liquid dense phase)
			- Scramblase #recherche #Arashiki2016 , [[Arashiki2016 An Unrecognized Function of Cholesterol]]:
				- Activator: #Ca²⁺
				- Inhibitor: #Cholesterol
- passive trans membrane movement:
	- mechanic force: 
		- define new energy term as hook energy simplistic and not to the standard of today #recherche 
		- #Verma 2022 paper about cholesterol distribution could be interesting #recherche also to think about cholesterol's role 

#### Big questions with the modelling idea in general:
- Does it make sense for the reference model to start from a equilibrium mixture to produce asymmetry? #questions
	- newer papers suggest #PM of #RBC stable even protein mediated transport blocked #experiments #citation 
		- how long is PM stable asymmetric if all known protein transport blocked, here various conditions should be tested #experiments. Conditions: No block, Total block, ATP blocked, Ca²⁺ blocked/induced, K⁺ blocked/induced and if possible cholesterol reduced
	- an equilibriated PM is found in nature? #citation (not relevant biological membrane) 
		- probably look at the older #Heinrich papers to understand the reasoning for this choice of test #recherche
