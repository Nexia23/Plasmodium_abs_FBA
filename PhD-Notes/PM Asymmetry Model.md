#### Changes from #Frickenhaus #Frickenhaus_1999:
- protein mediated transport :
	- simplification of transport reactions
		- one step like a tunnel
		- two step with protein bound intermediate stage
	- add regulation:
		- K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Cholesterol:
			- Flippase #recherche :
				- Activator: Ca²⁺
				- Activator:  K⁺
				- Non-competitive Inhibition: Cholesterol might influence membrane location of flippase (liquid dense phase)
			- Scramblase #recherche #Arashiki2016 , [[Arashiki2016 An Unrecognized Function of Cholesterol]]:
				- Activator: #Ca²⁺
				- Inhibitor: #Cholesterol
- passive trans membrane movement:
	- mechanic force: 
		- define new energy term as hook energy simplistic and not to the standard of today #recherche 
		- #Verma 2022 paper about cholesterol distribution could be interesting #recherche also to think about cholesterol's role 
		- Protein role #recherche estimation of protein impact?

#### Big questions with the modelling idea in general:
- Does it make sense for the reference model to start from a equilibrium mixture to produce asymmetry? #questions
	- newer papers suggest #PM of #RBC stable even protein mediated transport blocked #experiments #citation 
		- how long is PM stable asymmetric if all known protein transport blocked, here various conditions should be tested #experiments. Conditions: No block, Total block, ATP blocked, Ca²⁺ blocked/induced, K⁺ blocked/induced and if possible cholesterol reduced
	- an equilibriated PM is found in nature? #citation (not relevant biological membrane) 
		- probably look at the older #Heinrich papers to understand the reasoning for this choice of test #recherche 

## Abstract of modelling intention
**Towards an ODE Model for Erythrocyte Plasma Membrane Lipid Asymmetry: Integrating Current Knowledge and Insights**

Plasma membrane(PM) lipid asymmetry is a fundamental characteristic of cellular membranes that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity and functionality. This research effort aims at constructing a comprehensive mathematical model to combine the existing knowledge and insights regarding lipid asymmetry in the erythrocyte plasma membrane.
Frickenhausen et al. (1998) developed a mathematical model using an extended thermodynamic informed ODE approach to replicate the asymmetric lipid distribution of the plasma membrane (PM). Since then, significant advancements have been made in understanding lipid flippases, scramblases, lipidomics, regulation of lipid flippases, and the functional implications of lipid asymmetry. Thus our new mathematical model seeks to provide an improved and more holistic framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of lipid species within the plasma membrane.
The model will incorporate the enzymatic activities of flippases and scramblases, taking into account their interactions with specific lipid species and membrane proteins. The dynamics of lipid translocation and redistribution are mathematically described, enabling quantitative analysis of lipid asymmetry maintenance and perturbations.
Furthermore, the model integrates lipidomics data to account for the composition and distribution of lipid species in each membrane leaflet. By incorporating the regulatory mechanisms governing flippase activity, such as signaling pathways, the model aims to capture the intricacies of lipid asymmetry regulation. By simulating perturbations in lipid asymmetry, the model may provide insights into the consequences of altered lipid distribution and guide future experimental investigations.
Overall, the construction of this mathematical model represents a significant step toward a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of plasma membrane lipid asymmetry in addition to the impressive body of work in experimental biology and biophysics as well as molecular modeling. By integrating current knowledge and insights, this model will offer a tool for investigating the complex dynamics of lipid species within the plasma membrane and has the potential to guide further experimental studies and therapeutic interventions related to lipid asymmetry-associated diseases.
