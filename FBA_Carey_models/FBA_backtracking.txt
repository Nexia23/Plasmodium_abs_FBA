for mapping the ODE and the GEM need same annotation of the metabolites and reactions

metas will be probably manuel and reactions the mapped metabolites can be used.
-> for iPfa it kinda is already done

next is lump_prep.m
Function to irreversibilize model and sets the objective to 'total flux'
should not be too hard to implement just understanding is lacking

after they use bktr_run.m

here functionalities of cobra are used like 
converToIrreversible()
converIrrevFluxDistribution()
see if they are in cobra.py

after it will be finding reactions and add fluxes for leak flux of specific metabolite
